This was an exercise on SparkSQL to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.
The project was done using Google Colab.

NOTE: I have worked on this exercise alone. I followed the class example codes. Did not need any help from LA.
